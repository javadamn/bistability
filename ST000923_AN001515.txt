PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Longitudinal Multiomics of the Human Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Multi'omics Database (IBDMDB) includes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	multi’omics measurements from over 100 subjects, sampled biweekly over up to a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	year in both adult and pediatric patients with IBD (Crohn’s disease and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	ulcerative colitis), along with non-IBD controls. Data types include fecal
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metabolomes, and proteomes, as well as host
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	genetics, intestinal biopsy transcriptomes, epigenetics, and 16S amplicon
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	profiles. Subjects’ medical histories and demographics are collected at
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	baseline and medication, diet, and disease activity profiled longitudinally.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Longitudinal Metabolomics of the Human Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	A number of factors contribute to the complex array of small molecules that
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	occur in stool; including diet, gut flora, and gut function. Comprehensive
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	profiling of the stool metabolome therefore can provide detailed phenotypic
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	information on health status, metabolic interactions between the host and the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	microbiome, and interactions among gut microbes. Here, we applied metabolomics
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	to characterize stool samples collected longitudinally from inflammatory bowel
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	disease (IBD) patients and non-IBD controls who participated in the Integrative
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Human Microbiome Project (iHMP). A total of 546 stool samples were analyzed
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	using a platform comprised of four complementary liquid chromatography tandem
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods designed to measure polar metabolites and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	lipids. Each method used high resolution/accurate mass (HRAM) profiling to
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	measure both metabolites of confirmed identity and yet to be identified
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	metabolite peaks. 81,867 de-isotoped LC-MS peaks were measured, out of which 597
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	were annotated based on confirmation with authentic reference standards. Pooled
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	stool extracts inserted and analyzed throughout the analysis queues to evaluate
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	analytical reproducibility showed a median coefficient of variation of 5.1%
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	among known metabolites and 24.2% across all 81,867 features. Owing to
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	differences in water content and heterogeneity among stool samples, total median
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	scaling was used to standardize the metabolomics data. In addition to being
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	accessible at the Metabolomics Workbench repository, these metabolomics data
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	will be incorporated into a multi’omic database
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	(https://www.hmpdacc.org/ihmp/) that will enable the study of associations
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	between the gut microbiome and IBD.

#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Samples were thawed on ice and then centrifuged (4 ˚C, 5,000 x g) for 5
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	minutes. Ethanol was evaporated using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas using a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	nitrogen evaporator (TurboVap LV; Biotage, Charlotte, NC) and stored at -80 ˚C
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	until all samples in the study had been dried. Aqueous homogenates were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	generated by sonicating each sample in 900 μl of H2O using an ultrasonic probe
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	homogenizer (Branson Sonifier 250) set to a duty cycle of 25% and output control
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	of 2 for 3 minutes. Samples were kept on ice during the homogenization process.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The homogenate for each sample was aliquoted into two 10 μL and two 30 μL in
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	1.5mL centrifuge tubes for LC-MS sample preparation and 30 μL of homogenate
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	from each sample were transferred into a 50 mL conical tube on ice to create a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	pooled reference sample. The pooled reference mixture was mixed by vortexing and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	then aliquoted (100 μL per aliquot) into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Aliquots and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reference sample aliquots were stored at -80 °C until LC-MS analyses were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	conducted. Pairs of pooled reference samples were inserted into the queue at
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	intervals of approximately 20 samples in order to assess analytical variance and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	as a reference to standardize within and across batches by “nearest
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	neighbor” scaling.
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	Stool homogenates (30 μL) were extracted using 90 μL of methanol containing
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	PGE2-d4 as an internal standard (Cayman Chemical Co.; Ann Arbor, MI) and
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	centrifuged (10 min, 9,000 x g, 4°C). The supernatants (10 μL) were injected
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	onto a 150 x 2.1 mm ACQUITY BEH C18 column (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 450 μL/min with 20% mobile phase A
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	(0.01% formic acid in water) for 3 minutes followed by a linear gradient to 100%
